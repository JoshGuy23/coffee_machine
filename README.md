# coffee_machine

This program simulates a coffee machine. The "machine" takes a command from the user and either performs the appropriate function or dispenses the appropriate coffee. The coffee is only dispensed if the user paid enough in coins and if the proper amount of resources are left in the machine. The additional functions include displaying a report of the resources left and the amount of money made, and turning off the machine.
To operate the machine, when prompted enter the displayed coffee types or "report" or "off" without the quotation marks.
